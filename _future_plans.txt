Future Plans for next release:
- Big ideas:
	- Docker container to make it more plug and play as well as it being identical on each run and on multiple machines.
	- Live ISO version?
- Improvements:
	- Extracting archives and looking at the files inside
	- More sophisticated scanning of the files especially for all the non-singed files
	- Use Assembyline4 to check and validate code (https://github.com/CybercentreCanada/assemblyline-base)


- Flow for: Open Source Tv√§tt - Signature Analysis of Code, Hash, And Malware (OST SACHAM)
	1. python start script
		- takes user inputs
		- verify hash
		- builds container
		- start container (series? or parallel?)
	2. signature container
		- runs the scripts similar to it works today but with Extracting functionality
	3. Script scan container
		- analyses script files
	4. Bad code container
		- analyses malware signature
	6. wait for user to look at results before killing container

ToDo
1. Containers
2. Find software and functions for:
	a. Script Analysis
	b. Bad code / Malware Analysis
3. rebuild code to work in modular containers
4. test
