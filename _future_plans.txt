# Future Plans for next release:
- Big ideas:
	- Docker container to make it more plug and play as well as it being identical on each run and on multiple machines.
	- Live ISO version?
- Improvements:
	- analyses everything in a folder (same as iso and future zip)
	- Extracting archives and looking at the files inside
	- More sophisticated scanning of the files especially for all the non-singed files

		- https://github.com/keithjjones/malgazer
		- https://github.com/joxeankoret/pyew
		- https://github.com/hiddenillusion/AnalyzePE
	- Use Assembyline4 to check and validate code (https://github.com/CybercentreCanada/assemblyline-base)
	- support of online and offline installation of OST, meaning whole system including OS in a VM environment
		- .OVA and step-by-step installation
		- air gapped updater for definition files and so on needs to exist




- Flow for: Open Source Tv√§tt - Signature Analysis of Code, Hash, And Malware (OST SACHAM)
	1. python start script
		INPUT
			scan type
				file
				folder
			input file
			type
				Microsoft
				Red Hat
				Ubuntu
				VMWare
			hash
		OUTPUT
			result.csv
		STEPS
			- take and validate user inputs
			- verify hash
			- generate hash
			- prepare for containers
				- mounts iso (if applicable)
				- create relevant dirs
				- copy files to working dirs
			- builds container
			- start container (series? or parallel?)
			- gather results from all containers and generate result.csv
	2. signature container
		INPUT
			scan folder
			type
				Microsoft		(microsoft Container [Fedora])
				Red Hat			(RPM container [Fedora])
				Ubuntu			(deb container [Ubuntu]+[Microsoft])
				VMWare			(?)
			var WORKIGNDDIR = ./output/{type}/{file name}/{date}/
		OUTPUT
			signature_result.csv
			WORKIGNDDIR/signature.*
		STEPS
			- runs the scripts similar to it works today but with Extracting functionality
			- generate signature_result.csv
	3. Script scan container
		INPUT
			scan folder
			var WORKIGNDDIR = ./output/{type}/{file name}/{date}/
		OUTPUT
			script_result.csv
			WORKIGNDDIR/script.*
		STEPS
			- analyses script files
			- generate script_result.csv
	4. Bad code container
		INPUT
			scan folder
			var WORKIGNDDIR = ./output/{type}/{file name}/{date}/
		OUTPUT
			malware_result.csv
			WORKIGNDDIR/malware.*
		STEPS
		- analyses malware signature
	6. wait for user to look at results before killing container

# ToDo

1. Containers
2. Find software and functions for:
	a. Script Analysis
	b. Bad code / Malware Analysis
3. rebuild code to work in modular containers
4. test
